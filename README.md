# Bank-System-C++-Console-Application-OOP-Based-
This is a console-based Bank System built in C++ as part of my learning journey in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project demonstrates solid OOP principles with clean and modular code architecture.


# Features
Built with pure OOP concepts: classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.

Structured into two main parts:

# 1
CRUD Operations – Create, Read, Update, Delete accounts and users.

# 2
Transactions – Perform real banking operations like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
